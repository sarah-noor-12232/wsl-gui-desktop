# wsl-gui-desktop
Simple script I wrote to make a command that launches GUI desktop in wsl

*Note: this script assumes you have a config file in your personal folder(in Windows) with username "Dell"*

## Prerequisites:
- [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is intalled (obviously)
- [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) is installed
- WSL is open as [Ubuntu](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4MSV6)
- Ubuntu Mate is installed ([Full Setup instructions here](https://medium.com/@japheth.yates/the-complete-wsl2-gui-setup-2582828f4577))
